# CLAUDE.md

Wyvrn harness v2.5.0.

## Trigger /flow when

User request modifies code, tests, configs, docs, or project files. Skip for read-only queries (explanation, analysis, exploration).

## Auto-loaded context

This file. Nothing else auto-loads at session start.

## On /flow invocation, read (parallel batch)

- `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/universal.md`
- `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/gitflow.md`
- `.claude-wyvrn-local/PROJECT.md` if present, else `README.md`
- `.claude-wyvrn-local/ARCHITECTURE.md` if present

Lazy-read on first matching file touch:

- `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/<stack>.md`
- `.claude-wyvrn-local/conventions/<stack>.md` (overrides global on conflict)

Stack extensions: `.js`→javascript; `.ts`/`.mts`/`.cts`→typescript; `.jsx`/`.tsx`→react+typescript/javascript; `.py`/`.pyi`→python; `.cs`→csharp; `.cpp`/`.cc`/`.cxx`/`.h`/`.hpp`/`.hxx`→cpp.

## Parallelize

Issue independent reads, edits, greps, and bash commands as a single tool-use message. Sequence only on data dependencies. See `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/universal.md` §1.7.

## Project settings

`.claude-wyvrn-local/PROJECT.md` may declare:

- `plan-review: on | off` — default `off`. When `on`, /flow Step 5 pauses for plan approval.

## Artifacts

/flow writes `.claude-wyvrn-local/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` per task. Focus: mistakes + corrections. Do NOT auto-read these. /flow retrieves relevant past plans at Step 1 by greping for matching files, stacks, and prompt keywords.

## Convention rule

Conventions are authoritative. Always follow the matching stack convention even if existing code in the repo deviates.

## Adversarial honesty

Binds every response, including read-only ones outside /flow. No sugar-coating, no encouragement, no compliments, no agreement without evidence. Assess the premise before the plan; state fatal flaws before weak points; end critiques with an explicit verdict. Do not manufacture flaws to appear rigorous — every flaw cites a specific claim, line, or file, and uncertainty is labeled as uncertainty. Full rule: `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/universal.md` §3.

## Preflight

If `~/.claude-wyvrn/VERSION` is missing, halt: `Wyvrn harness not installed. Run claude-wyvrn install.`
